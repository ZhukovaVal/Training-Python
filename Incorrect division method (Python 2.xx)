Description:
This method, which is supposed to return the result of dividing its first argument by its second,
isn't always returning correct values. Fix it.

test.assert_equals(divide_numbers(9, 4), 2.25)
test.assert_equals(divide_numbers(21, 5), 4.2)
test.assert_equals(divide_numbers(9, 3), 3)
test.assert_equals(divide_numbers(1, 100), 0.01)
